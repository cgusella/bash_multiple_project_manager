# bash_multiple_project_manager

**Descrption:**
Manage multiple git projects in a Debian-based linux terminal.

## What it does

This application allows you to choose between all git projects you have inside some folder and, at the same time and for all the project you have chosen
* add new branch
* delete a branch
* checkout branch
* update projects
* prune from all non-local branches
* commit and push.

## How to use it

This bash script manages git projects inside some folder.

Save this script inside that folder to see the git projects you want to manage.

Make the script executable and launch it.

## Tips
Since there is no a vertical scrollbar, if you have many projects to display you can only enlarge you terminal window.

It is not a satisfactory solution, but I'm working on it.

All changes are local, so you are not affecting any file on remote repos.
